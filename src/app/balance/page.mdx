# Balance

The balance of a team is the amount of credits it has to send messages.  {{ className: 'lead' }}

The value returned by this endpoint is a reflection of your balance as of the most recent campaign. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Transactions can have the following types:

**Dailies** - These transactions are what will be calculated after a campaign has been sent, this will be accompanied with a comment stating which campaign it is related to. This comment box may also be populated if a transaction is added manually by Digitonic staff member to correct a balance or prodide a credit or debit where appropriate.

**Monthlies** - These transactions are a result of an aggregation of the previous months total daily transactions and will be reflected as such. A comment will also be added stating what month the aggregation is related to along with a credit or debit with the balance number.

A statement of your transaction history can be found in your team settings. This area will show aggregations of the previous months balances in either a positive or negative state. The current months total transactions will be shown as a list.

**Transaction Aggregations take place on the last day of every month**
