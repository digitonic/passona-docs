# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Passona API. We'll cover how to get started using our API client and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Passona API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](https://passona.co.uk/settings#/api).
</Note>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Passona offers a client for PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install the client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ language: 'php' }}
# Install the Passona PHP SDK
composer require digitonic/passona-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/sdks" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Check out our list of first-party SDKs</>
  </Button>
</div>
